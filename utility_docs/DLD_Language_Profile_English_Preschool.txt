DETAILED LANGUAGE PROFILE FOR ENGLISH-SPEAKING PRESCHOOLERS WITH DLD
================================================================================
Ages: 3-5 years
Based on comprehensive literature review
================================================================================

I. MORPHOSYNTACTIC DOMAIN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Grammatical Morphology - Clinical Markers

Tense/agreement marking deficits represent the most robust clinical marker of 
English DLD. Children show INCONSISTENT (not absent) use of finiteness morphology:

1. Third-person singular -s
   - DLD children ages 4-5: ~37-60% accuracy in obligatory contexts
   - TD peers: 78-92% accuracy
   - Example errors: "He walk" instead of "He walks"

2. Past tense -ed
   - Similar inconsistency patterns
   - Producing bare stems: "walk" for "walked"

3. Auxiliary BE
   - Frequent omission in progressive constructions
   - Example: "Mommy coming" for "Mommy is coming"

4. Copula BE
   - Inconsistent use in obligatory contexts

Extended Optional Infinitive Account:
Children treat finite marking as optional, producing bare stem verbs in 
contexts requiring tense/agreement.

TEGI Composite Grammar Scores (% correct):
- Age 4;0-4;5: 37.35% (SD = 23.26)
- Age 4;6-4;11: 44.50% (SD = 23.45)
- Age 5;0-5;5: 54.39% (SD = 23.36)


B. Mean Length of Utterance (MLU in Morphemes)

MLU serves as a reliable marker showing persistent depression across the 
preschool period. Large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.89-1.22) throughout ages 3-5.

Age 3 DLD:
- 3;0-3;5: Mean = 3.07 morphemes (SD = 0.48)
- 3;6-3;11: Mean = 3.36 morphemes (SD = 0.80)

Age 4 DLD:
- 4;0-4;5: Mean = 3.64 morphemes (SD = 0.80)
- 4;6-4;11: Mean = 3.95 morphemes (SD = 0.70)

Age 5 DLD:
- 5;0-5;5: Mean = 4.09 morphemes (SD = 0.70)
- 5;6-5;11: Mean = 4.34 morphemes (SD = 0.67)

Developmental trajectory:
- Growth rate: ~0.5-0.6 morphemes per year
- DLD children perform approximately 1 SD below TD peers
- Gap closure is minimal; relative standing remains impaired


C. Sentence Structure

Children with DLD produce simpler syntactic structures than age-matched peers:

- Reduced use of complex sentences
  * Fewer subordinate clauses
  * Fewer relative clauses
  * Limited embedded structures

- Limited verb types
  * Preference for high-frequency, semantically simple verbs
  * Reduced use of mental state verbs (think, know, believe)
  * Reduced use of causatives

- Simpler noun phrases
  * Less elaboration with adjectives and modifiers
  * Limited prepositional phrase modification


================================================================================
II. LEXICAL-SEMANTIC DOMAIN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Vocabulary

Receptive Vocabulary (moderate impairment, less severe than morphosyntax):
- PPVT-R standard scores: Mean = 81-88 (~1 SD below mean)
  * Age 4;0-4;5: Mean = 83.00 (SD = 15.33)
  * Age 5;0-5;5: Mean = 85.30 (SD = 12.90)

Expressive Vocabulary:
- Word-finding difficulties
- Reduced vocabulary diversity in spontaneous speech
- Similar ~1 SD impairment


B. Lexical Access and Processing

Recent eye-tracking evidence:
- Intact lexical access for high-frequency words
- Difficulties with lower-frequency vocabulary
- Similar temporal processing to TD peers for familiar words
- Numerical differences emerge for less frequent items


C. Verb Learning

Particularly challenging area:
- Difficulty acquiring new verbs in experimental contexts
- Reduced benefit from retrieval practice compared to TD peers
- Limited verb diversity in spontaneous speech
- Slower consolidation of newly learned verbs


================================================================================
III. NARRATIVE AND DISCOURSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Narrative Macrostructure

Significant deficits compared to age-matched peers:

1. Story Grammar Elements
   - Reduced inclusion of story components:
     * Setting
     * Initiating event
     * Consequence
     * Resolution

2. Story Coherence
   - Difficulties maintaining thematic consistency
   - Problems with logical sequencing
   - Disorganized narrative flow

3. Referencing
   - Inconsistent or ambiguous use of pronouns
   - Unclear referential forms
   - Listener confusion about character identity


B. Narrative Microstructure

- MLU in narratives: ~1.0-1.5 morphemes higher than conversational contexts
  * Still depressed relative to TD peers

- Grammatical errors: ~21% of utterances contain one or more errors
  * Omissions of required elements
  * Agreement errors
  * Word order problems

- Error rates increase in narrative contexts due to cognitive demands


================================================================================
IV. CONTEXT EFFECTS - TASK-DEPENDENT VARIATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Language output varies significantly by elicitation context:

A. Narrative/Picture Description Tasks
   - Longest MLU
   - More complex syntax attempted
   - Higher grammatical error rates (increased cognitive demands)
   - More structured, complete utterances required

B. Conversational/Play-Based Contexts
   - Moderate MLU
   - More elliptical utterances
   - Simpler structures
   - Pragmatically appropriate short responses
   - Context-dependent language

C. Question-Answer Contexts
   - Shortest MLU
   - Brief, targeted responses
   - Often formulaic utterances ("I don't know")
   - Single-word or phrase-level answers

Expected Task Effect:
Narrative MLU approximately 1.5 morphemes higher than question-answer contexts 
for school-age children. Effect present but potentially smaller in preschoolers.


================================================================================
V. EXPECTED MLU RANGES BY AGE AND CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONVERSATIONAL/FREE PLAY CONTEXT (baseline):

Age 3 DLD: 2.6-3.6 morphemes
Age 4 DLD: 2.8-4.7 morphemes  
Age 5 DLD: 3.4-5.0 morphemes

NARRATIVE/PICTURE DESCRIPTION CONTEXT (estimated):

Age 3 DLD: 4.1-4.6 morphemes
Age 4 DLD: 4.6-5.5 morphemes
Age 5 DLD: 5.1-5.8 morphemes

TOY PLAY CONTEXT (similar to conversational):

Age 3 DLD: 2.6-3.6 morphemes
Age 4 DLD: 2.8-4.7 morphemes
Age 5 DLD: 3.4-5.0 morphemes


================================================================================
VI. COGNITIVE-LINGUISTIC RELATIONSHIPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Nonverbal Intelligence

Children with DLD perform within normal range on nonverbal IQ measures:
- Age 4-5 DLD: Mean NVIQ = 95-97 (SD = 9-11)
- Effect sizes vs. TD peers: d = 0.79-1.04 (moderate)
- Group means tend toward lower end of average range
- This distinguishes DLD from intellectual disability


B. Verbal Working Memory

Verbal working memory deficits are characteristic:
- Affects sentence processing
- Impacts grammatical morpheme production
- Interacts with morphosyntactic learning
- Reduced capacity for holding and manipulating linguistic information


================================================================================
VII. DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Persistence of Deficits

Language impairment persists throughout the preschool period without 
spontaneous resolution:

- Omnibus language scores remain 1+ SD below mean from ages 3-5
- Effect sizes remain large (d > 0.90) across developmental period
- Gap closure is minimal
- Absolute MLU increases with age
- Relative standing remains impaired
- Intervention is necessary; children do not "grow out of it"


B. Optimal Diagnostic Age

Age 4;0 represents the optimal time for reliable DLD diagnosis:
- Diagnostic stability maintained through school age
- Earlier than age 4: some children show late blooming
- By age 4: persistent DLD clearly distinguished from late talkers


================================================================================
VIII. CLINICAL SUMMARY - CANONICAL PROFILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The canonical English DLD preschool profile involves:

1. SEVERE, PERSISTENT MORPHOSYNTACTIC DEFICITS
   - Tense/agreement marking: 30-60% accuracy (vs. 80-90% for TD)
   - Most robust clinical marker

2. DEPRESSED MLU
   - 1 SD below age expectations
   - Ages 3-5: 3.0-4.5 morphemes in conversation
   - Ages 3-5: 4.1-5.8 morphemes in narratives

3. MODERATE VOCABULARY LIMITATIONS
   - Receptive vocabulary ~1 SD below mean (standard scores 81-88)
   - Expressive vocabulary similarly affected

4. NARRATIVE DIFFICULTIES
   - Impaired macrostructure (story grammar, coherence)
   - Impaired microstructure (syntax, morphology)
   - ~21% utterances contain grammatical errors

5. TASK-DEPENDENT VARIATION
   - Better performance in supportive, conversational contexts
   - Increased errors in cognitively demanding narrative tasks
   - Appropriate pragmatic adaptations to context

6. NORMAL-RANGE NONVERBAL COGNITION
   - NVIQ 85+ (typically 95-97)
   - Distinguishes from intellectual disability

7. PERSISTENT IMPAIRMENT
   - No spontaneous resolution
   - Requires intervention
   - Diagnostic stability from age 4 onward


================================================================================
IX. WHAT DLD IS NOT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important distinctions:

1. NOT primarily a vocabulary disorder
   - Morphosyntax more severely affected than lexicon

2. NOT characterized by absent verbs
   - Pattern is UNMARKED verbs (bare stems), not missing verbs
   - Example: "He walk" not "He ___ to school"

3. NOT characterized by near-zero morpheme accuracy
   - Pattern is INCONSISTENCY (30-60%), not absence (0-10%)

4. NOT explained by low nonverbal IQ
   - Nonverbal cognition in normal range

5. NOT a severe speech sound disorder
   - Mild phonological issues may co-occur
   - Primary deficit is language structure, not articulation

6. NOT transient or outgrown
   - Persists without intervention
   - Stable diagnosis from age 4


================================================================================
X. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When analyzing language samples from DLD preschoolers:

1. Use appropriate normative data
   - Rice et al. (2010) provides 6-month interval norms ages 3-9
   - Account for task type (conversation vs. narrative)

2. Calculate morpheme accuracy in obligatory contexts
   - Count only contexts requiring the morpheme
   - Don't penalize pragmatically appropriate ellipsis

3. Distinguish bare stems from verb omission
   - "He walk" = verb present but unmarked (typical DLD)
   - "He ___ home" = verb omitted (atypical for English DLD)

4. Account for age effects
   - Include age as covariate in statistical models
   - Test for age × group interactions
   - Report descriptive statistics by narrow age bands

5. Report task context clearly
   - Narrative/picture description
   - Conversational/free play
   - Question-answer
   - Different contexts yield different MLU values

6. Use adequate sample sizes
   - Minimum 50 utterances for reliable MLU
   - 100+ utterances preferred for morpheme analysis
