Boysy and doggy go forest. Doggy play with bees, boysy look in hole. Boysy say ""Froggy, where?"" Prairie dog hit boysy's nose. Doggy howl, bees chase doggy.

Boysy climb on rock, say ""Froggy, where?"" Boysy on deer's head. Deer run, boysy and doggy fall down. Splash! Boysy say ""Shh"" to doggy. ""Let's look, doggy.""

Boysy and doggy look on log. They see mommy frog, daddy frog, and little froggy! Boysy and doggy happy. They take froggy home. Froggy happy too!"
